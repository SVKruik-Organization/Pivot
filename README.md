# SK Pivot

Welcome to SK Pivot, a simple and powerful URL shortener for SK Platform and personal use. Some links to for example the documentation can be very long, so SK Pivot was created. Also on a new domain, as `*.stefankruik.com` would defeat it's purpose.

---

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://url.skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
